Hi there! I'm Sarah Elizabeth (SE for short), a researcher at the intersection of psychology and technology. I am passionate about enhancing our understanding of how technology and digital environments impact human behavior, mental health, and well-being. With a background in both psychology and programming, I am committed to exploring digital mental health, implementation science, cyberpsychology, and human-computer interaction.

My research interests are fueled by the conviction that the interconnectivity between humans and technology leads to an inextricable link between technology and mental helath. By investigating the motivations, experiences, and effects surrounding human-technology interactions, I aim to raise and address critical questions that will help shape our understanding of this rapidly evolving landscape. My interests ecompass the psychological and ethical implications of digital mental health interventions and rapidly advancing technology like cyborgs, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality. I am particularly interested in developing, implementing, and evaluating innovative technological tools and platforms to improve mental health and promote overall well-being for individuals, groups, and society. 

As a proponent of implementation science, I am committed to ensuring research advancements are effectively integrated into mental health care settings and digital environments. By developing and implementing evidence-based digital mental health interventions built upon community-informed research, we can break down barriers, reduce stigma, and provide personalized, affordable care– ultimately fostering more inclusive and accessible mental health and digital landscapes.

I am always excited to connect with others who share my passion for digital mental health and research. Please feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss potential collaborations or simply exchange insights.
